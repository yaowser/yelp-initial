So I will do:
- convert rest of the regular text review w/ NLP
- use normalization/ minMaxScalar
- see if feature transformation is necessary
- use random sampling technique to match 50:50 regular vs non-regular ratio 
- interpret the weights
- add/test new features [ extream, review# and none/regular ratio (of corresponding restaurant) ]
