       "\"I give this place 3.5 stars. If dining in the evening (which I did), I would recommend sitting outside in the patio. It's quaintly decorated and sets a nice dinner mood, perfect for catching up with friends, family, or even your significant other.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur waitress recommended we order everything family style so that we could try a bit of everything, which ended up being a good idea b/c some of the dishes came out smaller than expected, whereas other dishes were of more appropriate dinner entree size. This place is beer and wine only. Also, the menu changes depending on what is in season and what the chef decides to prepare for the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dishes I thought were note-worthy:\\r\\n1) arugula salad -- very fresh with a wonderful vinaigrette\\r\\n2) the country ham -- sliced thin, served with a creamy cheese spread, cantaloupe melons, and sliced/toasted bread -- more of a dish to share than have on your own as an entree in my opinion\\r\\n3) grilled hanger steak -- cooked appropriately, served with a chimichurri sauce and topped with a fried egg\\r\\n4) baked trout -- served with a tasty creamed corn\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dishes I thought were just ok:\\r\\n1) hamachi crudo -- really small serving if you're planning to eat it on your own -- this dish is definitely meant to share\\r\\n2) braised bacon -- super rich, also meant for sharing, not enough to fill a person up for dinner\\r\\n\\r\\nThe not note-worthy:\\r\\n1) fish and grits -- flavorless in my opinion\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so disappointed they didn't have the soft shell crab burger on the menu that night we dined there. We didn't try the desserts. This is a dog friendly establishment. I probably won't come back, but am glad I tried it once. If I hear on the grapevine that they have the soft shell crab burger on the menu again, I will try to stop by.\""
